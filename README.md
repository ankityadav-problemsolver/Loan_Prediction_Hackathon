## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

We trained a classification model using a labeled dataset to predict loan approvals. The model evaluates key features such as:

- Applicant Income
- Co-applicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Term
- Credit History
- Education
- Property Area
- Marital Status
- Employment Status
- Gender

The ML pipeline includes preprocessing (encoding, handling missing values), model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model serialization using `joblib`.
